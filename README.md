# Mobile-Lighting-Control
My honours year project. I have attached javascript file that runs the server and the html for the three interfaces of the program.
The code lightcontrol-server.js runs on node.js and needs a few extensions such as the node-dmx script by wiedi https://github.com/wiedi/node-dmx.git. 
Your lights need to be connected to the host computer with a dmx-usb that dones timing in its hardware.
